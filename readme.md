# CSC3231 Coursework

## Overview

The challenge is to use Unity3D, or other engine, to create a graphical simulation of an alien planet surface.  The planet could be of any type â€“ rock, ice, lava, city, forest, desert, lagoon, etc. 
The goal of the coursework is to integrate as many graphical effects as you can into the scene, while keeping the frame-rate sufficiently high to maintain an interactive experience.
